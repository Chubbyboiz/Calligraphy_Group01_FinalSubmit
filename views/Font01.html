        <h5 class="p5">by Alejandro Paul</h5>
        </p>
        <p class="infor_font">
          Bellissima Script have received a Certificate of Excellence at the Communication Arts Typography annual
          competition.
          <br><br>
          While in the same vein and spirit as Burgues and Compendium, Bellissima began from an entirely different
          thread from those fonts. It started with Alex Trochut generously showing me a gorgeous lettering book from his
          grandfather's library: Bellezas de la Caligrafía, by Ramón Stirling, 1844.
          <br><br>
          Stirling was one of the Latin calligraphy pioneers who introduced a refined version of English calligraphy in
          Spain and made it popular in the nineteenth century.
          <br><br>
          Some scans from that book served as initial basis for the caps in my Poem Script. But it was always
          in the back of my mind that I should do a copperplate, and the Stirling model was the perfect source.
          My intention was to veer away from Stirling's exuberant ornamentation, and work within simplified forms of his
          ideas. As it usually is with most of my projects, Bellissima became its own bird and shaped its own flying
          patterns. Suddenly there were many ligatures, multiple endings and swashed connections, hundreds of alternates
          for both uppercase and lowercase.
          <br><br>
          Bellissima has an effusive energy that appeals much beyond its sourcing. It's intended for these modern times
          of appreciation for old crafty things like stationery and letterpress, where its origins help it shine
          brightly.
